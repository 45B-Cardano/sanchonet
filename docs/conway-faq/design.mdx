This Ledger era contains the evolving governance model as described within CIP-1694.

## Follow the development

The Ledger team use Github issues to track development, thus all planned Conway work can be seen via the [cardano-ledger Issues](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aconway).
