* Cardano node and Cardano CLI v.8.3.0-pre bring the ability for **any stake key** to create governance actions.

### Pre-requisites

* Payment key pair
* Address with funds
* Stake OR Stake pool key pair
* A SanchoNet node

### Preparing a new constitution

1. Write a constitution update and save it to a text file:

```
echo 'We are Cardano and we are going to change the world!' > constitution.txt
```

2. Upload the `constitution.txt` file to a URL so that everyone can read it, for example, https://shorturl.at/asIJ6.

3. Check the hash of the `constitution.txt` file using (b2sum)[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/b2sum.1.html]. It is recommended that you download the file from the URL, just in case anything changes during the upload process.

````
wget https://shorturl.at/asIJ6 -O constitution.txt
````

```
b2sum -l 256 constitution.txt
```

This returns the hash and the file name:

```
3d2a9d15382c14f5ca260a2f5bfb645fe148bfe10c1d0e1d305b7b1393e2bd97  constitution.txt
```

4. Include a justification for the governance action, for example, a document with the necessary reasoning and analysis for the proposed changes: https://shorturl.at/xMS15.
This document will not remain on-chain but will be captured by db-sync so that voting tools, explorers, wallets, and other tools can display it.

````
wget https://shorturl.at/xMS15 -O justification.txt
````
````
b2sum -l 256 justification.txt
````
This returns:
````
13b0234dab754774e4530a0918d8272491541a8d2f6cf8ab0a10abdaa81f2440  justification.txt
````

### Creating the governance action file

1. Create the action file:

```
cardano-cli conway governance action create-constitution \
  --testnet \
  --governance-action-deposit 0 \
  --stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
  --proposal-url "https://shorturl.at/xMS15" \
  --anchor-data-hash "13b0234dab754774e4530a0918d8272491541a8d2f6cf8ab0a10abdaa81f2440" \
  --constitution-url "https://shorturl.at/asIJ6" \
  --constitution "$(cat constitution.txt)" \
  --out-file constitution.action
```

2. If everything goes well, you should be able to view the content of the `constitution.action` file:

```
cat constitution.action
```
````
{
    "type": "Governance proposal",
    "description": "",
    "cborHex": "841a000f4240581de0bdc1c6e7b196abefcd5864c71843f481272a6590e3de7749b7931fed8305f68282781968747470733a2f2f73686f727475726c2e61742f6173494a3658203d2a9d15382c14f5ca260a2f5bfb645fe148bfe10c1d0e1d305b7b1393e2bd97f682781968747470733a2f2f73686f727475726c2e61742f784d53313558206f890de0c6e418e6526e2b1aa821850cb87aee94a6d77dc2a2e440116abc8e09"
}
````

### Submitting the governance action in a transaction

1. You can now build a transaction with the proposal:

```
  cardano-cli conway transaction build \
  --testnet-magic 4 \
  --tx-in $(cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --testnet-magic 4 --out-file /dev/stdout | jq -r 'keys[0]') \
  --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \
  --proposal-file constitution.action \
  --out-file tx.raw
```

2. Sign the transaction:

```
cardano-cli transaction sign \
  --tx-body-file tx.raw \
  --signing-key-file payment.skey \
  --testnet-magic 4 \
  --out-file tx.signed
```

3. Submit the transaction to the chain:

```
cardano-cli transaction submit \
  --testnet-magic 4 \
  --tx-file tx.signed
```

**You have now submitted a constitution update governance action!**

### Getting the governance action ID

1. You need the action ID to share it with others on **Discord**[^1] and seek their support for your action. The simplest method to obtain it is by querying the balance again. The transaction ID and index of the transaction that submitted the constitution proposal serve as the action ID. Therefore, the command

```
cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --testnet-magic 4 --out-file /dev/stdout | jq -r 'keys[0]'
```

should provide the UTXO that created the constitution proposal:

```
639a43144dc2c0ead16f2fb753360f4b4f536502dbdb8aa5e424b00abb7534ff#0
```

2. It is possible to query the active governance actions:

````
cardano-cli conway governance query gov-state --testnet-magic 42 | jq .gov.curGovActionsState
````
````
{
  "639a43144dc2c0ead16f2fb753360f4b4f536502dbdb8aa5e424b00abb7534ff#0": {
    "action": {
      "contents": [
        null,
        {
          "constitutionAnchor": {
            "dataHash": "3d2a9d15382c14f5ca260a2f5bfb645fe148bfe10c1d0e1d305b7b1393e2bd97",
            "url": "https://shorturl.at/asIJ6"
          }
        }
      ],
      "tag": "NewConstitution"
    },
    "actionId": {
      "govActionIx": 0,
      "txId": "639a43144dc2c0ead16f2fb753360f4b4f536502dbdb8aa5e424b00abb7534ff"
    },
    "committeeVotes": {},
    "dRepVotes": {
      "keyhash-9be19f30a2feaab39d0941e8b4c91b7a3bf7f2e295fdd54d4981bbd8": "VoteYes"
    },
    "deposit": 0,
    "expiresAfter": 15,
    "proposedIn": 14,
    "returnAddr": {
      "credential": {
        "key hash": "d2efcc978ec130d5204c395446f7ff512c345127f3e30c72c73a1358"
      },
      "network": "Testnet"
    },
    "stakePoolVotes": {}
  }
}
````
Similarly, to get **only** the the action IDs, run
````
cardano-cli conway governance query gov-state --testnet-magic 42 | jq '.gov.curGovActionsState | keys[]'

639a43144dc2c0ead16f2fb753360f4b4f536502dbdb8aa5e424b00abb7534ff#0
````
