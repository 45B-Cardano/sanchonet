# Contributing to SanchoNet

Welcome to SanchoNet, where issues and pull requests are more than welcome!

For straightforward issues, such as typo corrections, we encourage you to make a pull request with the necessary fix, rather than opening an issue requesting someone else to address it.

Our intention is to make this website community-led, fun, and exciting. The more contributors we have, the better the experience will become.

Step onto the island of Barataria and join the adventure!

## How to create a pull request?

Follow these steps to submit your contribution:

1. Test your changes locally using Docusaurus
2. Submit your pull request
3. A single review is sufficient for merging your pull request
4. The website will auto-deploy after the merge.

## Pull request review process

PRs will be reviewed to ensure they do not violate the code of conduct. Reviews will be completed in a timely manner on a best effort basis.
